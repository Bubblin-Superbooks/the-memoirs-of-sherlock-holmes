By the way, I have had a letter from Lord Holdhurst.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! What did he say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was cold, but not harsh. I dare say my severe illness prevented him from being that. He repeated that the matter was of the utmost importance, and added that no steps would be taken about my future&mdash;by which he means, of course, my dismissal&mdash;until my health was restored and I had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that was reasonable and considerate,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Come, Watson, for we have a good day&rsquo;s work before us in town.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
