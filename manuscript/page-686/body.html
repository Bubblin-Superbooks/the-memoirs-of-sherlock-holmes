You can do nothing before Monday. It has been a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes. You hope to place me in the dock. I tell you that I will never stand in the dock. You hope to beat me. I tell you that you will never beat me. If you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
