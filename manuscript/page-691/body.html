<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The practice is quiet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I have an accommodating neighbor. I should be glad to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And to start to-morrow morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it is most necessary. Then these are your instructions, and I beg, my dear Watson, that you will obey them to the letter, for you are now playing a double-handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in Europe. Now listen! You will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria to-night. In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the Strand end of the Lowther Arcade, handing the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away.</p></div> </div>
