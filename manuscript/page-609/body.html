<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us&mdash;a small, foxy man with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had come.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said he, tartly. &ldquo;You are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit on them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;out of my last fifty-three cases my name has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. I don&rsquo;t blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced, but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not against me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
