<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am all attention,&rdquo; said Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>&ldquo;This is Wednesday evening,&rdquo; said Mr. Melas. &ldquo;Well then, it was Monday night&mdash;only two days ago, you understand&mdash;that all this happened. I am an interpreter, as perhaps my neighbor there has told you. I interpret all languages&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;but as I am a Greek by birth and with a Grecian name, it is with that particular tongue that I am principally associated. For many years I have been the chief Greek interpreter in London, and my name is very well known in the hotels.</p><p>&ldquo;It happens not unfrequently that I am sent for at strange hours by foreigners who get into difficulties, or by travelers who arrive late and wish my services. I was not surprised, therefore, on Monday night when a Mr. Latimer, a very fashionably dressed young man, came up to my rooms and asked me to accompany him in a cab which was waiting at the door.</p></div> </div>
