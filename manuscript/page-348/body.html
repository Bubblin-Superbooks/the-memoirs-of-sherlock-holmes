Who brought the note, then? Or did it come through the post?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have made inquiries,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;William received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday. The envelope was destroyed by him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; cried Holmes, clapping the Inspector on the back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the postman. It is a pleasure to work with you.
