I have told you that she had only recently recovered from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for being at work.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"You should be in bed,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Come back to your duties when you are stronger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She looked at me with so strange an expression that I began to suspect that her brain was affected.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"I am strong enough, Mr. Musgrave,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"We will see what the doctor says,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You must stop work now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see Brunton.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
