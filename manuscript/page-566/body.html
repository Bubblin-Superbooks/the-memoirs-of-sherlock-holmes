It was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside him, who rose as we entered.</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I leave, Percy?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>He clutched her hand to detain her. &ldquo;How are you, Watson?&rdquo; said he, cordially. &ldquo;I should never have known you under that moustache, and I dare say you would not be prepared to swear to me. This I presume is your celebrated friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
