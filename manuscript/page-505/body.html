<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You wonder,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;why it is that Mycroft does not use his powers for detective work. He is incapable of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I thought you said&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that he was my superior in observation and deduction. If the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an arm-chair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever lived. But he has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points which must be gone into before a case could be laid before a judge or jury.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
