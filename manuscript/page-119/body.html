In the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer.

I ran into the other room, but it was equally deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in the whole house.</p></div> </div>
