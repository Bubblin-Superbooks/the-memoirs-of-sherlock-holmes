As I entered the house the maid ran into the hall with a startled face.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is your mistress?&rsquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think that she has gone out for a walk,&rsquo; she answered.</p><p>&ldquo;My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. Then of course I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once and forever.</p></div> </div>
