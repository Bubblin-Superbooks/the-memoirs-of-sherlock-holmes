The governor has never held up his head from that evening, and now the life has been crushed out of him and his heart broken, all through this accursed Hudson.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What power had he, then?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, that is what I would give so much to know. The kindly, charitable, good old governor&mdash;how could he have fallen into the clutches of such a ruffian! But I am so glad that you have come, Holmes. I trust very much to your judgment and discretion, and I know that you will advise me for the best.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
