<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been?&rsquo; I asked, more sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that you are surprised,&rsquo; said she, and I could see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastenings of her mantle. &lsquo;Why, I never remember having done such a thing in my life before. The fact is that I felt as though I were choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. I really think that I should have fainted if I had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few minutes, and now I am quite myself again.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the time that she was telling me this story she never once looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones. It was evident to me that she was saying what was false.</p></div> </div>
