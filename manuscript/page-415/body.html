<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Morrison is a little ethereal slip of a girl, with timid eyes and blond hair, but I found her by no means wanting in shrewdness and common-sense. She sat thinking for some time after I had spoken, and then, turning to me with a brisk air of resolution, she broke into a remarkable statement which I will condense for your benefit.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I promised my friend that I would say nothing of the matter, and a promise is a promise,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but if I can really help her when so serious a charge is laid against her, and when her own mouth, poor darling, is closed by illness, then I think I am absolved from my promise. I will tell you exactly what happened upon Monday evening.</p></div> </div>
