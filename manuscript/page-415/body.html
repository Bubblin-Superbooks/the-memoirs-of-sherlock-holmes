He had a very dark, fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams. His hair and whiskers were shot with gray, and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"Just walk on a little way, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barclay; &ldquo;I want to have a word with this man. There is nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo; She tried to speak boldly, but she was still deadly pale and could hardly get her words out for the trembling of her lips.</p></div> </div>
