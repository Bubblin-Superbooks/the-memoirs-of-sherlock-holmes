<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished. In an incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, I have endeavored to give some account of my strange experiences in his company from the chance which first brought us together at the period of the &ldquo;Study in Scarlet,&rdquo; up to the time of his interference in the matter of the &ldquo;Naval Treaty&rdquo;&mdash;an interference which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious international complication. It was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill.</p></div> </div>
