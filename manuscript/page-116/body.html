Who are these people, that you should visit them at such an hour?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have not been here before.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How can you tell me what you know is false?&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Your very voice changes as you speak.

I shall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the matter to the bottom.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, Jack, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; she gasped, in uncontrollable emotion.
