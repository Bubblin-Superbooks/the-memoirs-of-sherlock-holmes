He walked into the dining-room as we sat after dinner, and announced his intention in the thick voice of a half-drunken man.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"I&rsquo;ve had enough of Norfolk,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down to Mr. Beddoes in Hampshire. He&rsquo;ll be as glad to see me as you were, I dare say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"You&rsquo;re not going away in an unkind spirit, Hudson, I hope,&rdquo; said my father, with a tameness which made my blood boil.</p></div> </div>
