<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Hum! A doctor&rsquo;s&mdash;general practitioner, I perceive,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Not been long in practice, but has had a good deal to do. Come to consult us, I fancy! Lucky we came back!&rdquo;</p><p>I was sufficiently conversant with Holmes&rsquo;s methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in the lamplight inside the brougham had given him the data for his swift deduction. The light in our window above showed that this late visit was indeed intended for us. With some curiosity as to what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum.</p></div> </div>
