<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For three months after taking over the practice I was kept very closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for I was too busy to visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere himself save upon professional business. I was surprised, therefore, when, one morning in June, as I sat reading the British Medical Journal after breakfast, I heard a ring at the bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old companion&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear Watson,&rdquo; said he, striding into the room, &ldquo;I am very delighted to see you! I trust that Mrs. Watson has entirely recovered from all the little excitements connected with our adventure of the Sign of Four.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
