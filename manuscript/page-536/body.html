Inference&mdash;that she had been in England some little time, but he had not been in Greece.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, we will presume that she had come on a visit to England, and that this Harold had persuaded her to fly with him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is more probable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then the brother&mdash;for that, I fancy, must be the relationship&mdash;comes over from Greece to interfere. He imprudently puts himself into the power of the young man and his older associate. They seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;of which he may be trustee&mdash;to them.
