I had never heard the name before and could not imagine what he wanted with me; but, of course, I asked her to show him up.

He had a brisk kind of way with him and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the value of time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Hall Pycroft, I believe?&rsquo;&rdquo; said he.</p></div> </div>
