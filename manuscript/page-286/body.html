<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"Mr. Musgrave, sir,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with emotion, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear disgrace, sir. I&rsquo;ve always been proud above my station in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will be on your head, sir&mdash;it will, indeed&mdash;if you drive me to despair. If you cannot keep me after what has passed, then for God&rsquo;s sake let me give you notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will. I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to be cast out before all the folk that I know so well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;"You don&rsquo;t deserve much consideration, Brunton,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Your conduct has been most infamous. However, as you have been a long time in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you.</p></div> </div>
