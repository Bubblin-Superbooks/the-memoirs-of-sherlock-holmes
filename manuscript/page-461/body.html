<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will excuse my coming in, doctor,&rsquo; said he to me, speaking English with a slight lisp. &lsquo;This is my father, and his health is a matter of the most overwhelming importance to me.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was touched by this filial anxiety. &lsquo;You would, perhaps, care to remain during the consultation?&rsquo; said I.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not for the world,&rsquo; he cried with a gesture of horror. &lsquo;It is more painful to me than I can express. If I were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures I am convinced that I should never survive it. My own nervous system is an exceptionally sensitive one. With your permission, I will remain in the waiting-room while you go into my father&rsquo;s case.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
