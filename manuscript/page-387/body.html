<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that you have no gentleman visitor at present. Your hat-stand proclaims as much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted if you will stay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll fill the vacant peg then. Sorry to see that you&rsquo;ve had the British workman in the house. He&rsquo;s a token of evil. Not the drains, I hope?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, the gas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it. No, thank you, I had some supper at Waterloo, but I&rsquo;ll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
