<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in the same company as myself, and the belle of the regiment, ay, and the finest girl that ever had the breath of life between her lips, was Nancy Devoy, the daughter of the color-sergeant. There were two men that loved her, and one that she loved, and you&rsquo;ll smile when you look at this poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say that it was for my good looks that she loved me.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, though I had her heart, her father was set upon her marrying Barclay. I was a harum-scarum, reckless lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I would have had her when the Mutiny broke out, and all hell was loose in the country.</p></div> </div>
