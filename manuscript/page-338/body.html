The man was seen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. But he was off like a deer after the shot that killed poor William Kirwan was fired.

Mr. Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. They both heard William the coachman calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran down to see what was the matter.
