Don&rsquo;t let there be any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel it. I don&rsquo;t want to argue about that. A man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. But there&rsquo;s this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
