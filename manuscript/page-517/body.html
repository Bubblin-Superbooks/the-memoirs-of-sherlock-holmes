<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;As you can imagine, I was utterly taken aback by such an address. My companion was a powerful, broad-shouldered young fellow, and, apart from the weapon, I should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is very extraordinary conduct, Mr. Latimer,&rsquo; I stammered. &lsquo;You must be aware that what you are doing is quite illegal.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but we&rsquo;ll make it up to you. I must warn you, however, Mr. Melas, that if at any time to-night you attempt to raise an alarm or do anything which is against my interests, you will find it a very serious thing. I beg you to remember that no one knows where you are, and that, whether you are in this carriage or in my house, you are equally in my power.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
