These people always clear out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have already said that he must have gone to King&rsquo;s Pyland or to Mapleton. He is not at King&rsquo;s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday night.</p></div> </div>
