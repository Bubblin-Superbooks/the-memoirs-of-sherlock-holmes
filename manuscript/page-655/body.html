It was quarter-past ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired.</p><p>&ldquo;I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The key!&rdquo; ejaculated Phelps.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes; I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly without her cooperation you would not have that paper in your coat-pocket.
