They are endorsed outside, as you see, &lsquo;Some particulars of the voyage of the bark Gloria Scott, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th October, 1855, to her destruction in N. Lat. 15 degrees 20&rsquo;, W. Long. 25 degrees 14&rsquo; on Nov. 6th.&rsquo; It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this way:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have known me, which cuts me to the heart;</p></div> </div>
