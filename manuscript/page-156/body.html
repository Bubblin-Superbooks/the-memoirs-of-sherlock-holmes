Back came an answer by return, saying that if I would appear next Monday I might take over my new duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory.

Anyhow it was my innings that time, and I don&rsquo;t ever wish to feel better pleased. The screw was a pound a week rise, and the duties just about the same as at Coxon&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;And now I come to the queer part of the business.
