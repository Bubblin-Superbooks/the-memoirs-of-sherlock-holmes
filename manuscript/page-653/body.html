Then he rose, lit his pipe, and settled himself down into his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it afterwards,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;After leaving you at the station I went for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening, when I set off for Woking again, and found myself in the high-road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.</p></div> </div>
