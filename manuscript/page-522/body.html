As he turned towards us the glint of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is this Mr. Melas, Harold?&rsquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well done, well done! No ill-will, Mr. Melas, I hope, but we could not get on without you. If you deal fair with us you&rsquo;ll not regret it, but if you try any tricks, God help you!&rsquo; He spoke in a nervous, jerky fashion, and with little giggling laughs in between, but somehow he impressed me with fear more than the other.</p></div> </div>
