<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro,&rdquo; said Holmes, with some impatience.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I know about Effie&rsquo;s history. She was a widow when I met her first, though quite young&mdash;only twenty-five. Her name then was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was young, and lived in the town of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. They had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven per cent.</p></div> </div>
