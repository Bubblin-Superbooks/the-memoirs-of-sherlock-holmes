<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a gray suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you tell me where I am?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;I had almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
