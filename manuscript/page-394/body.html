<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Colonel Barclay&rsquo;s family life appears to have been a uniformly happy one. Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair. On the whole, he thinks that Barclay&rsquo;s devotion to his wife was greater than his wife&rsquo;s to Barclay. He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day. She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. But they were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. There was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow.</p><p>&ldquo;Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in his character.</p></div> </div>
