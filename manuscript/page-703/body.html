A minute later a carriage and engine could be seen flying along the open curve which leads to the station. We had hardly time to take our place behind a pile of luggage when it passed with a rattle and a roar, beating a blast of hot air into our faces.</p><p>&ldquo;There he goes,&rdquo; said Holmes, as we watched the carriage swing and rock over the points. &ldquo;There are limits, you see, to our friend&rsquo;s intelligence. It would have been a coup-de-maitre had he deduced what I would deduce and acted accordingly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
