Now, of the two men, it is clear that the one who wrote the &lsquo;at&rsquo; and &lsquo;to&rsquo; was the ringleader.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you get at that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other. But we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to fill up.</p></div> </div>
