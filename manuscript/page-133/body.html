Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could.</p><p>&ldquo;There are the lights of my house,&rdquo; he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees. &ldquo;And here is the cottage which I am going to enter.&rdquo;</p><p>We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. As we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across the blind.</p></div> </div>
