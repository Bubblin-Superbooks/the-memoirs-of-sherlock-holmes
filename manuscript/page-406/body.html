There could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door-key. A most careful search had failed to discover it in the room. Therefore it must have been taken from it. But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel&rsquo;s wife could have taken it. That was perfectly clear. Therefore a third person must have entered the room. And that third person could only have come in through the window.</p></div> </div>
