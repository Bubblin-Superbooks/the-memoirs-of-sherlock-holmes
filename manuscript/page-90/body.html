<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ask him in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; he came in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long did he wait?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin&rsquo; and a-stampin&rsquo; all the time he was here. I was waitin&rsquo; outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. At last he outs into the passage, and he cries, &lsquo;Is that man never goin&rsquo; to come?&rsquo; Those were his very words, sir. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll only need to wait a little longer,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait in the open air, for I feel half choked,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be back before long.&rsquo; And with that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn&rsquo;t hold him back.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
