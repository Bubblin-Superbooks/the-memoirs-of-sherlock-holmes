<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case. It is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter. It is the supposed murder of Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am investigating.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It has not excited much attention yet, except locally. The facts are only two days old. Briefly they are these:</p><p>&ldquo;The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish regiments in the British army. It did wonders both in the Crimea and the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion. It was commanded up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a musket.</p></div> </div>
