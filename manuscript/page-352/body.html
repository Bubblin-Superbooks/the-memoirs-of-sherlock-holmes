<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Shall I send you home in my trap?&rdquo; asked old Cunningham.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, since I am here, there is one point on which I should like to feel sure. We can very easily verify it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow William was not before, but after, the entrance of the burglar into the house. You appear to take it for granted that, although the door was forced, the robber never got in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I fancy that is quite obvious,&rdquo; said Mr. Cunningham, gravely. &ldquo;Why, my son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard any one moving about.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
