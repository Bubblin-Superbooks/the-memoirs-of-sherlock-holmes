I thought I&rsquo;d get it either with Mr. Beddoes or with you.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Trevor. &lsquo;You know where Mr. Beddoes is?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bless you, sir, I know where all my old friends are,&rsquo; said the fellow with a sinister smile, and he slouched off after the maid to the kitchen. Mr. Trevor mumbled something to us about having been shipmate with the man when he was going back to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the lawn, he went indoors. An hour later, when we entered the house, we found him stretched dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa.</p></div> </div>
