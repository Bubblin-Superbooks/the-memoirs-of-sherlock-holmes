<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and I stared with astonishment at our client.</p><p>&ldquo;You may well look surprised, Dr. Watson; but it is this way,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;When I was speaking to the other chap in London, at the time that he laughed at my not going to Mawson&rsquo;s, I happened to notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion. The glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. When I put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was the same man. Of course you expect two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out, and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or my heels. Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and tried to think it out.</p></div> </div>
