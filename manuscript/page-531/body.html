On the other side I saw the red signal-lamps of a railway.</p><p>&ldquo;The carriage which had brought me was already out of sight. I stood gazing round and wondering where on earth I might be, when I saw some one coming towards me in the darkness. As he came up to me I made out that he was a railway porter.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you tell me what place this is?&rsquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wandsworth Common,&rsquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can I get a train into town?&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
