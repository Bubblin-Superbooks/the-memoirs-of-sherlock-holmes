<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o&rsquo;clock he rejoined us in the Colonel&rsquo;s smoking-room. He was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr. Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.</p><p>&ldquo;I wished Mr. Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small matter to you,&rdquo; said Holmes, &ldquo;for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; answered the Colonel, warmly, &ldquo;I consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working. I confess that they quite surpass my expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
