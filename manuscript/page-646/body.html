<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why had he asked Miss Harrison to remain in the sick-room all day? Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae that he intended to remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until I fell asleep in the endeavor to find some explanation which would cover all these facts.</p><p>It was seven o&rsquo;clock when I awoke, and I set off at once for Phelps&rsquo;s room, to find him haggard and spent after a sleepless night. His first question was whether Holmes had arrived yet.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here when he promised,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and not an instant sooner or later.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
