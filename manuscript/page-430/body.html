<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to England or to make myself known to my old comrades? Even my wish for revenge would not make me do that. I had rather that Nancy and my old pals should think of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back, than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. They never doubted that I was dead, and I meant that they never should. I heard that Barclay had married Nancy, and that he was rising rapidly in the regiment, but even that did not make me speak.</p><p>&ldquo;But when one gets old one has a longing for home. For years I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of England. At last I determined to see them before I died.</p></div> </div>
