<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest, in which I had the privilege of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the headings of &ldquo;The Adventure of the Second Stain,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Adventure of the Tired Captain.&rdquo; The first of these, however, deals with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply.</p></div> </div>
