<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Holmes showed me into a small chamber which looked out into Pall Mall, and then, leaving me for a minute, he came back with a companion whom I knew could only be his brother.</p><p>Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and stouter man than Sherlock. His body was absolutely corpulent, but his face, though massive, had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was so remarkable in that of his brother. His eyes, which were of a peculiarly light, watery gray, seemed to always retain that far-away, introspective look which I had only observed in Sherlock&rsquo;s when he was exerting his full powers.</p><p>&ldquo;I am glad to meet you, sir,&rdquo; said he, putting out a broad, fat hand like the flipper of a seal. &ldquo;I hear of Sherlock everywhere since you became his chronicler. By the way, Sherlock, I expected to see you round last week, to consult me over that Manor House case. I thought you might be a little out of your depth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
