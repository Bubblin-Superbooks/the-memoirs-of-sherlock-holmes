We hired a hansom, and in half an hour we were at the address which had been given to us. A young woman opened the door, who proved to be Mrs. Tangey&rsquo;s eldest daughter. Her mother had not come back yet, and we were shown into the front room to wait.</p><p>&ldquo;About ten minutes later a knock came at the door, and here we made the one serious mistake for which I blame myself. Instead of opening the door ourselves, we allowed the girl to do so. We heard her say, &lsquo;Mother, there are two men in the house waiting to see you,&rsquo; and an instant afterwards we heard the patter of feet rushing down the passage.</p></div> </div>
