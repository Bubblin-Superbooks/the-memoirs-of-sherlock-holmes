Moriarty will again do what I should do. He will get on to Paris, mark down our luggage, and wait for two days at the depot. In the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a couple of carpet-bags, encourage the manufactures of the countries through which we travel, and make our way at our leisure into Switzerland, via Luxembourg and Basle.&rdquo;</p><p>At Canterbury, therefore, we alighted, only to find that we should have to wait an hour before we could get a train to Newhaven.</p></div> </div>
