Watson, this knife is surely in your line?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is what we call a cataract knife,&rdquo; said I.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body,&rdquo; said the Inspector. &ldquo;His wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the moment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
